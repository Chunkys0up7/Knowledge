# Knowledge Management System Concepts

This document explains the key concepts and terminology used in the Knowledge Management System.

## Key Concepts

### Knowledge Base (KB)

A Knowledge Base is a dedicated Git repository containing processed documents, metadata, and citation information. It serves as the primary organizational unit for related documents.

**Key characteristics:**
- Self-contained Git repository
- Standardized directory structure
- Includes raw files and processed versions
- Contains metadata, citations, and knowledge organization
- Maintains document history and versioning

### Document Processing

The transformation of raw documents into structured, enhanced formats suitable for retrieval and citation.

**Processing steps:**
1. **Ingestion**: Raw document is copied to the KB
2. **Format Detection**: Document type is identified
3. **Content Extraction**: Content is extracted and preserved
4. **Structure Analysis**: Document structure is identified
5. **Metadata Creation**: Document metadata is generated
6. **Transformation**: Document is converted to markdown with enhancements
7. **Citation Generation**: Citation information is created
8. **Storage**: Processed document is stored in the KB

### Citation System

A comprehensive system for tracking the origin and precise location of all information in the knowledge base.

**Citation components:**
- **Document ID**: Unique identifier for the document
- **Source Location**: File path and repository information
- **Structural Location**: Section, class, function, page, or line information
- **Author & Version**: Creator and version information
- **Citation Text**: Human-readable citation string

### Semantic Chunking

The process of dividing documents into meaningful, context-preserving segments for retrieval.

**Chunking principles:**
- **Semantic Boundaries**: Chunks follow natural content boundaries
- **Context Preservation**: Important context is maintained within chunks
- **Overlap**: Content overlap between chunks ensures concept continuity
- **Citation Consistency**: Each chunk maintains citation information
- **Size Optimization**: Chunks are sized appropriately for vector embedding

### Knowledge Maps

Visual and structural representations of relationships between documents in a knowledge base.

**Map types:**
- **Document Type Maps**: Group documents by content type
- **Topic Maps**: Group documents based on content similarity
- **Process Maps**: Show workflow and procedural relationships
- **Reference Maps**: Show cross-document references

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The process of enhancing LLM outputs with retrieved context from the knowledge base, including citations.

**RAG components:**
- **Query Processing**: Understanding the information need
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant chunks
- **Context Assembly**: Creating a coherent context from chunks
- **Generation**: Creating a response based on context
- **Citation Inclusion**: Adding source citations to the response

## Processing Workflows

### Standard Document Processing

The typical workflow for processing a document:

1. **BulkIngestor** receives the document
2. **SmartIngestor** identifies the document type
3. Appropriate handlers extract content and structure
4. **CitationProcessor** creates citation information
5. Document is stored in the KB repository
6. **SemanticChunker** divides the document for RAG
7. Chunks are stored with citation information
8. Vector representations are created for retrieval

### Bulk Processing

For processing large volumes of documents:

1. **BulkIngestor** scans the directory
2. Files are grouped into batches for processing
3. Each batch is processed with resource controls
4. Progress is tracked and reported
5. Knowledge maps are generated upon completion
6. Index files are updated
7. Changes are committed to the Git repository

### Automated Workflow

For continuous processing with directory watching:

1. **DocumentWorkflow** monitors specified directories
2. New files are detected and copied to a workflow directory
3. Processing script is generated for the batch
4. Files are processed in batches
5. Metadata and citations are created
6. Knowledge maps are updated
7. Changes are committed to the Git repository

## Search and Retrieval

### Vector Search

The primary search mechanism uses vector embeddings:

1. Document chunks are converted to vector embeddings
2. Vectors are stored in a vector database
3. Search queries are converted to vectors
4. Similar vectors are retrieved using nearest neighbor search
5. Results are ranked by similarity score
6. Citation information is attached to results

### Hybrid Search

Enhances vector search with keyword matching:

1. Vector search retrieves initial results
2. Keyword matching refines the results
3. Results are re-ranked based on combined scores
4. Citations are preserved throughout the process

### RAG Integration

The combination of search and LLM generation:

1. User query is processed
2. Relevant chunks are retrieved using search
3. Context is assembled from chunks with citations
